                <p>Trade & Barter - is an experimental marketplace where you only trade goods with another with benefits.
                    Trading can be trace back to our ancient ancestors prehistoric times around 150,000 years and we still
                    continue the practice to this day. Our goal here is to bring back our old ways of getting our items without
                    spending a cent... except for shipping >:].

            <p>If Brawl's on the battlefield and you can't hear him coming, it's time to check your audio receptors,
               because chances are you've gone deaf. Brawl's main distinguishing characteristic is VOLUME. No matter
               if he's talking (yelling), moving (clanking and rattling), or fighting (yelling, clanking, rattling,
               and blasting) you're sure to hear him doing it, as is anyone else in the county. As if that wasn't
               enough, he is also a ball of barely contained rage and violence with a hair-trigger temper. This
               makes even his comrades wary, but it does make him a force to be reckoned with on the
               battlefield... as long as the mission doesn't require stealth. Or zero casualties.
               Brawl combines with his fellow Combaticons to form Bruticus.</p>
